TODO:

- Clean Elaboration data code
- Explain how data have been retrieved, explain it in data and exploratory analysis chapter
- Explain upon which conditions KME and KDE are the same and when they differ


DONE:
- Make polyfit for every desired order
- python code in src all lowercase for convention
- Consider spline instead of polynomial so that we mitigate oscillations ==> results are reasonable
