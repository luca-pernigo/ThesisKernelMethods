Analysis of experiments and results
\\
Building on the theory introduced in \ref{ch:point} and \ref{ch:prob}, this section covers the experiments carried out and the results obtained.

- Comments
\\
- Comparison
\\
- Table of loss scores
\\
Plots:
\\
- Plots for visualizing timeseries with quantiles bounds
\\
- Other plots that will come up to mind

\section{Quantile forecasting}
In this subsection we compare performance of quantile regressor considering the GEFCom2014 dataset.
\\
- experiment for quantile estimator on gefcom2014 and we are good
