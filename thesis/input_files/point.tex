This chapter covers the theory of the most widely used method for point forecasting in the EF literature. Besides discussing the theory underlying these models, this and the following chapter include also a couple of worked examples in order to get acquainted with the practical applications of models.
\section{Exponential smoothing}

\section{Multiple linear regression}

\section{Autoregressive models}
explain their theory
and how the procedure how they are used
IMPORTANT: load series is not a stationary series so before applying AR we have to perform stationary tests or differencing steps
