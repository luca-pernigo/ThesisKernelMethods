When it comes to probabilistic forecasting, there are a couple of standard practical approaches; conceptually they can be grouped into two main categories. The former class of approaches tries modelling the distribution of the observed data directly. The latter family of approaches constructs first a point forecast and then learns the distribution of the model's errors.
