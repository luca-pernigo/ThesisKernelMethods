- Explain how data has been retrieved.

- Data provider EPEX(entsoe retrieves its data)

- Explain the ETL(Extract Transform Load) pipeline
I set up.

- Explore data in order to get useful insights for
how to tune the models to get the most of them.

- Correlation and auto correlation plots

- Split train and test dataset
Explain carefully why it is important to carry
out an out of sample test and not in sample.
In sample test involves look ahead bias because we are
fitting the model on the data we want to predict,
thus it overfits on the data considered but it does
not generalize well.
