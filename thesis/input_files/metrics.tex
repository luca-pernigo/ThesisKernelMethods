Proper evaluation methods guide researchers in choosing the model that best fits their needs; thus, this chapter is dedicated to the most common evaluation metrics adopted by academics in the field of EF.

Nevertheless, we can evaluate the integral in closed form. 
As pointed out in \cite{proper_scores}, we can use lemma 2.2 of \cite{new_multi_tes1} or identity 17 of \cite{new_multi_test2}.
\\
The lemma states that ...
\\
Note that in our case the distribution G of Y1 and Y2 is degenerate, with all probability mass on a single point (x notation will need to be cleaned here). Since $G(t)=:$
\\
It follows that the third addend in the summation is zero since the expectation of Y1 Y2 with distribution G means the difference of two equal constant numbers.
\\
Additionally, since x is constant in the first term we have Y=x.
